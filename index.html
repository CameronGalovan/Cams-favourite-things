    <h1>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a pretty weird guy, so here is a wonky list of some of my interesting
      tastes.
    <hr /></p>
    <h2>Music</h2>

      I LOVE Music. I play piano, I sing in a choir, and I listen to it on a
      regular basis.
    </p>

    <h3>PIANO</h3>
    <p>
      On piano, I play a variety of songs, mainly from my piano book or scores
      of video games and movies. I've played piano since 2016 and have loved it
      ever since.

    <h3>CHOIR</h3>
    <p>
      I sing with
      <a href="https://www.edmontonyoungvoices.ca/" target="_blank"
        >EYV Choirs</a
      >, a wonderful choir where I have expanded my knowledge of music greatly
      and made great friends. Next July, we're taking a tour to Europe through
      Frankfurt, Prague, Vienna, and Salzburg. We mainly sing classical type
      music and obscure carols for our Christmas concert.
    </p>
    <h3>LISTENING TASTE</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      The music I mainly listen to is from video games, such as Super Mario and
      the Legend of Zelda. The instrumental themes in video games really appeal
      to me because they bring out a sense of environment and emotion that is
      very important with music. Plus, given that this music is designed to be
      played in the background of games for hours on end, it takes a long while
      to get bored of one particular song. Some of my favourites include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Main Theme of "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
      <li>Jump Up, Super Star! from Super Mario Odyssey</li>
      <li>"Rauru's Theme" from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
      <li>"Gusty Garden Galaxy" from Super Mario Galaxy</li>
      <li>"Ballad of the Goddess" from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</li>
      <li>"Escape from the City" from Sonic Adventure 2</li>
      <li>The Main Theme of "Wii Sports Resort"</li>
    </ul>

      I spend a majority of my free time either watching or playing video games.
